            <h2>What is Environmental Sustainability?</h2>
            <p>Environmental sustainability is the responsible use and conservation of resources in order to reduce harm to the natural environment, prevent resource depletion, and maintain long-term ecological balance. It entails making judgments and conducting activities that are beneficial to the health and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.</p>

            <h2>Why is Environmental Sustainability Important?</h2>
            <p>Environmental sustainability is important for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Resources:</strong> Sustainable practices help conserve natural resources like water, air, forests, and biodiversity, which ensures that these resources will be available to future generations.</li>
                <li><strong>Protecting Ecosystems:</strong> Taking care of ecosystems keeps them balanced and diverse, which helps them provide important services like cleaning water, pollinating plants, and controlling the climate.</li>
                <li><strong>Combatting Climate Change:</strong> Using sustainable practices helps to combat climate change. This means we emit fewer greenhouse gases, which helps lessen the effects of extreme weather, rising sea levels, and habitat loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Public Health:</strong> Diseases linked to pollution and environmental degradation are less common when there is cleaner air, water, and surroundings.</li>
            </ul>
